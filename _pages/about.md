Hello and welcome to my small corner on the Internet.

I am a simple, curious and versatile engineer living in Finland. 

I have been building hardware and software for around a decade, first in academia, then for field robots for an year, printed electronics for about four years and presently build it for 5G Applications. I have dabbled in lots of technologies during this time all the way from diodes and transistors, micro-controllers with few kilobytes of ram to Linux/Windows applications. I have designed small PCBs and electronic circuits, have written a lot embedded software for sensors, for robots, and wireless sensor networks protocols. I have also written software for robotic simulation and occasionally made android/iOS applications. However, my core skill and strengths lie in the field of [Embedded Software][Embedded]. I get a good kick out of packing as much functionalities as possible in a few kilo-bytes of ram and some tens of kilo-bytes of flash memory.

Currently I am working as Software Engineer with some awesome people at [Unikie][Unikie] on 5G Technology.

Regarding my education, I got my first masterâ€™s degree in Space Technology and Robotics from Erasmus Mundus SpaceMaster Programme after which I spent some time building hardware for robots. I then worked on printed electronics for a few years. But at present I am on hiatus from the world of Robotics and Space Tech. and currently work on 5G Technology. In brief, my plan was to be an academic, but I made a pivot to industry in 2015. I am also currently enrolled at the University of Oulu studying Product Management.

I was planning to study Field Robotics for my doctoral studies particularly Evolutionary Robotics. I have been fascinated by Evolution for almost a decade and keep reading research articles on it whenever I have free time. Had I started my PhD I would have studied Evolutionary and Genetic Algorithms in the context of Robotics, however life seemed to have a different plan for me.

I plan to use this web-site primarily as place to bookmark things I read, jot my thoughts down occasionally and to foray into the world of web technologies.

I like to meet and get to know fellow geeks and people with backgrounds different than mine and listen to their stories. [Twitter][Twitter] might be the fastest way if you would like to get in touch.
