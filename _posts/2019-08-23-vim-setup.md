I used to have a really good setup of vim, but have lost it in the last couple of years.
Well most of the time I just used to copy vimscripts until I got what I wanted. While trying to build 
back my old vim setup I found this blog [post][GoodVim]. I realized I never really understood what was
going into my vimrc file. So this is an attempt to slowly build back vim setup while also understanding
a little bit about what goes under the hood. I will keep updating this post whenever I add a plugin or 
feature to my vim setup.


### Plugin management with Vundle

Setup Instructions are nicely mentioned here: [Vundle GitHub][VundleHome].
First step is just to clone the vundle git repo to the .vim directory
```
$ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

```
Then setup a .vimrc file in the user home directory. The first line in the .vimrc
file is
```
set nocompatible
```
This disables compatibility with old vi and all improvement of Vim are enabled.
Source: [What is compatible mode in Vim][VimNoCompatible]

```
" set the runtime path to include Vundle and initialize
set rtp+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
call vundle#begin()
" if Vundle should install plugins in a different directory then 
" call vundle#begin('~/some/path/here')

" let Vundle manage Vundle plugin. required
Plugin 'VundleVim/Vundle.vim'

call vundle#end() "required
```
All plugins that need to be installed goes between _call vundle#begin()/end()_ block.
To install the plugins, just open vim and use this command:
```
:PluginInstall
```

### Colorscheme  installation

To use the dracula colorscheme, add the following to .vimrc
```
Plugin 'dracula/vim'
```
