My favorite one from the Tao of Programming.

> Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse. Software said:

> *“You are yin and I am yang. If we travel together we will become famous and earn vast amounts
of money.”* 

> And so they set forth together, thinking to conquer the world.

> Presently they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rags and hobbled
along propped on a thorny stick. Firmware said to them:

> *“The Tao lies beyond yin and yang. It is silent and still as a pool of water.
It does not seek fame, therefore nobody knows its presence. It does not seek
fortune, for it is complete within itself. It exists beyond space and time.”*

> Hardware and Software, ashamed, returned to their homes.

— __The Tao of Programming, Geoffrey James, 1987__
